# dBox contracts Project

1. dBox profile
   For the project party: dBox, A Saas On Blockchain, a decentralized community operation tool based on the concept of "play to build". Operators can use various gameplays to interact with community members: voting, bounty tasks, whitelist lottery, contributor recognition, etc. and recorded on the chain.
   For individuals: dBox, a tool for recording and rewarding contributions. People contributed to the community and continued to build during the gameplay. These actions will be recorded on the chain, and when more and more communities and individuals participate, dBox will eventually be a network of "personal reputation on the chain".
